Additionally, as you are aware, the PRC meetings are next \\nweek, December 12th & 13th and there is not enough time to gather \\ninformation.  We will, however, be reducing the number of Associates and \\nAnalysts that each PRC Rep is representing and will need several additional \\nReps. If you have individuals that should be nominated please send the names \\nto Terry Bosien.  The parameters that were used for the initial appointments \\nwere as follows:\\n\\nThe person must be a well-respected individual who is nominated/approved by \\nthe Office of the Chair of the Operating Company\\nThe Associate PRC Reps are vice presidents\\nThe Analyst PRC Reps are directors /sr. directors\\n\\nThe level of the PRC reps on the committee is important to adhere to for \\nseveral reasons.  First, Jeff wanted individuals at these levels to gain \\nadditional exposure in the organization and be involved in activities beyond \\ntheir business unit boundaries.  Additionally, it potentially places the PRC \\nRep in an awkward position and they may feel undue pressure in the meeting if \\nthey are required to disagree with a more senior individual.  \\n\\nWe have also received request from individuals wanting to \"observe\" the \\nmeeting.  As in the MD/VP process, individuals are not allowed to just \\nobserve if they are not a part of the Committee.  We attempted to have the \\nmajor units represented, however, it is not possible to have every division \\nrepresented.   Jeff Skilling spent over an hour with the PRC Reps explaining \\nwhy the individuals selected as PRC Reps, rather than the Associates\\' & \\nAnalysts\\' managers, should be the ones to represent the Associates & Analysts \\nin the PRC.  He also reiterated the importance of the PRC Reps\\' \\nresponsibilities which was to (1) meet with the Associates\\' and Analysts\\' \\nmanagers;  (2) gather as much information as possible and (3) advocate \\nobjectively for the individual.\\nAlso, if there are too many individuals in the room it is difficult or \\nimpossible to come to a consensus, which has been the case in the past.  \\n\\nI hope this is helpful.  If business units find this is not acceptable, they \\nshould seek approval for their attendance from Jeff Skilling.\\n\\nThanks for your understanding, cooperation and support.\\n\\nCharlene\\n\\n \\n\\n\\n', layout=Layout(height='500px')))), Box(children=(Textarea(value='Could you please forward my \"P\" number.
